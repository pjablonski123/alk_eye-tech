## Preps

Add photos to separate folders for each class.

In the case of this code https://github.com/pjablonski123/alk_eye-tech/blob/master/eva_3_4c_dss.ipynb
there were 4 folders with the following names: 

`classes = ['CNV', 'DME', 'DRUSEN', 'NORMAL']`

The name of the folder is the name of the class.
They were placed in each train and test folders:

`train_dir = '/content/drive/My Drive/TEST1/'

test_dir = '/content/drive/My Drive/TEST2/'`

The code read pictures from the folders and classes automatically.
